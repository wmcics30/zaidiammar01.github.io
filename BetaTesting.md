Tester: My sister

  During the test, my sister watched the simulation run without me telling her anything about it. She told me that I could work more
 colorful cars. She also suggested that the cars should stop a little further back from the intersection. Lastly she suggested that
 there should be lane markings, crosswalks, and lastly some building on the grass. Oddly enough many her as well as many people
 suggested that the cars should be able to turn right on red.
