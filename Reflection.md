  Overall the project was challenging and very satisfying to make. The toughest part I ound was to organize the if statements in such a way
would make sense not glitch out the simulation. Another hard part was to figure out how to make the car turn. For that I found a simple
but okay looking solution which was to change the width and height of the car as well as the state. I was trying to work on the cars
stopping behind each other but I did not manage it as I ran out of time. I liked doing this project and was fun all the way.
